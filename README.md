An intelligent, context-aware mobile agent powered by n8n workflows and OpenAI, built with modern Android architecture.

![Agent Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gaballah10/n8n-android-agent/master/presentation/src/main/res/drawable/agent_workflow.png)

This project demonstrates a full integration between:
- **n8n** for backend automation and memory-aware workflows
- **OpenAI Chat Module** with custom prompt engineering
- **Android (Jetpack Compose)** frontend with Clean Architecture, Hilt, and smooth UX using Lottie animations and shimmering loading states

The diagram above illustrates the core agent workflow and data flow between components.
